# Task 4 - Password Security & Security Analysis

In this task, I studied about Hashing, Encryption. 
        Then, I converted a weak password into hash.
        Then, I used John-the Ripper tool for crack it.

I learned how the passwords are cracked and the security breaches done in the real world scenerio.

This page contains my report of learnings and my work on this task.
